This documentaion outlines how a PSP (Payment Services Provider) can integrate with Intergiro Acquiring. This includes how to make an [Authorization](./api.html#authorization), [Verification](./api.html#verification), [Capture](./api.html#capture), [Refund](./api.html#refund) and [Cancelation](./api.html#cancelization).

We also provide documentation for how to make [rules](./rules.html#merchant-rules) for merchants in the acquirer. These rules can automatically reject authorizations, captures, refunds or cancelation based on boolean statements.

If you have any questions please contact support@intergiro.com.
